Angular Click X
===============

**clickX** is an alternative to core ``ngClick`` directive provided by ``ngTouch`` module.  
Simple, configurable & lightweight!

##### _Why?_
> DEPRECATION NOTICE: Beginning with Angular 1.5, this directive is deprecated and by default disabled. The directive will receive no further support and might be removed from future releases. If you need the directive, you can enable it with the [$touchProvider#ngClickOverrideEnabled](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngTouch/provider/$touchProvider) function. We also recommend that you migrate to [FastClick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick). To learn more about the 300ms delay, this [Telerik](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/300-ms-click-delay-ios-8/) article gives a good overview.

Install
----

Include the `click-x.js` / `click-x.min.js` script provided by this component in your app.

Make sure to add `tb.clickX` to your appâ€™s module dependencies.

```js
angular.module('yourApp', ['tb.clickX']);
````

Configuration
-------
Inject the ``clickXConfigProvider`` provider in your ``config`` block and configure ``clickX`` as follows:

* change default active class name (defaults to ``click-x-active``)

```js
clickXConfigProvider.setActiveClass('myNewClass');
```
* adjust swipe detection process
```js
clickXConfigProvider.setSwipeConfig({
  //required min distance traveled to be considered swipe (px)
  threshold: 50,
  //max distance allowed at the same time in perpendicular direction (px)
  restraint: 50,
  //max time allowed to travel that distance (ms)
  allowedTime: 400
});
```
