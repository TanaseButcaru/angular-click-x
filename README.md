Angular Click X
===============

**Click X** is an alternative to core ``ngClick`` directive provided by ``ngTouch`` component. Simple & lightweight!

##### _Why?_
> DEPRECATION NOTICE: Beginning with Angular 1.5, this directive is deprecated and by default disabled. The directive will receive no further support and might be removed from future releases. If you need the directive, you can enable it with the [$touchProvider#ngClickOverrideEnabled](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngTouch/provider/$touchProvider) function. We also recommend that you migrate to [FastClick](https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick). To learn more about the 300ms delay, this [Telerik](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/300-ms-click-delay-ios-8/) article gives a good overview.
